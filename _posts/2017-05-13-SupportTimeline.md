title: 'Support Timelines'
---

One of the things I find my self wondering when starting a project is what platforms and systems to support. Should I support older systems when their own vendor support may be about to expire? This leads to the question, how log will support last for the various systems?

So I have decided to try and put together the timelines (as wibbly wobbly timey winey as they are) for different systems. Hopefully I shall keep this up to date so that it cn be continually referenced.
