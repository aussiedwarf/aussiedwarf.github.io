title: 'About Me'

I am a indie game developer and software developer from Wollongong Australia. 

Arguably my first programming experiences was writing scripts for the first Neverwinter Nights game. I had always been interested in making games and had books filled with made up stats for some imaginary game I wanted to make. There were other books with stories, histories of fantasy world I created for the Dungeons and Dragons game I would run.

During high school was when I actually learnt to code. At the time we were taught Visual Basic which I took like a fish to water. It was the Good VB6 days and I was fortunate to have family who set me up at home. During my gap year after high school I was lucky enough to meet my future boss who helped to teach me c++ and game development.

I studied computer science at Wollongong University majoring in game design. I was majoring in software engineering but during my final year I began working in Queensland for Euclideon. I also met my partner in Wollongong which then meant having a long distance relationship (Don't do it).

At Euclideon I was responsible for making several systems and was fortunate to meet many great programmers. Unfortunatly I had picked up some allegies in QLD and my partner had work in NSW but would require retraining to move QLD as well as taking up a position at much lower pay. I ended up moving down to Wollongong where I founded Hypergiant Enterainment.

I worked on a couple of ideas, the first being a global fantasy and scifi map maker. This changed to one of my other passions Astronomy when I started nbody.space, a space physics simulation that runs on Mac, Windows, Linux, Android as well as a version for the browser. The eventual goal is to have a stand alone physics simulation and to then build a RTS strategy game on top. Work on this is current ongoing.
