title: 'Support Timelines'
---

One of the things I find my self wondering when starting a project is what platforms and systems to support. Should I or anyone support older systems when their own vendor support may be about to expire. This leads to the question, how log will support last for the various systems?

So I have decided to try and put together the time lines (as wibbly wobbly timey winey as they are) for different systems.
